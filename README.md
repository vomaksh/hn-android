HN Pocket
============

**HN Pocket** is an unofficial HackerNews client forked from **HN** project.

If you find any issues, please post them into the [Issues section](https://github.com/vomaksh/hnpocket/issues) or send a
[Pull request](https://github.com/vomaksh/hnpocket/pulls).

Note about Pull Requests: If you commit your additions into feature branches (http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) instead of
the master branch, you will have no problems later on when you pull in updates from my repo. If you do that, you always have a clean
master branch at all times (meaning it does not contain anything other than my repo's master branch commits).

## Setup

Import in Android Studio.

Create the following dummy properties file in the root directory.
```
keyStore=
keyStorePassword=
keyAlias=
keyAliasPassword=
```
